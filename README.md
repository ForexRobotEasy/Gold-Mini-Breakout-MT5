# Gold Mini Breakout MT5

This code is an Expert Advisor for MetaTrader 5 (MT5) developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to trade breakouts in the gold market. The Expert Advisor uses a combination of Moving Average (MA) and Average True Range (ATR) indicators to identify potential breakout levels and generate trading signals.

## Input Parameters

- `MA_Period` - Moving Average period (default: 14)
- `Range_Level` - Range level for breakout (default: 0.001)
- `ATR_Multiplier` - Multiplier for ATR (default: 2.0)

## How It Works

The Expert Advisor starts by calculating the initial Moving Average value and ATR value. It then uses these values to determine the initial breakout levels: upper level and lower level. 

During the execution function, the Expert Advisor checks for updates in the Moving Average. If there is a change, it updates the Moving Average value and recalculates the breakout levels accordingly. 

Next, it checks for potential breakouts by comparing the current price with the breakout levels. If the current high price is above the upper level, a potential buy signal is generated. If the current low price is below the lower level, a potential sell signal is generated.

Finally, the Expert Advisor checks for exiting trades based on the Average True Range. If the current Average True Range is greater than the specified ATR multiplier multiplied by the initial ATR value, all positions are exited.
